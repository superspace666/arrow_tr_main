# arrow_tr_main
### The arrow shoot control code of our TR robot of the ROBOCON competition.
##### The relationship between the pulling distance and the archery distance is linear in theory. We select different spring elongations, measure its archery distance, and use MatLab to fit. 
##### The pulling distance can be obtained by detecting the archery distance of the machine according to this linear relationship.
##### We use the position-loop figure PID to control the electric machinery
